Area of a cube is L^dim where L is the side length and dim is the number of
dimensions. To compute the area that is inside 0.05 and outside 0.95 we can
first compute the area inside which is 0.9^50. The remaining area which we would
like to measure is then 1-0.9^50.

It's interesting to note that as dim gets larger more and more of the hypercube
lies in this 10% space at the edges.
